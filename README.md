# 🧩 FTP Server Library for .NET

A flexible and easy-to-extend FTP server library built with C#.  
Created with focus on learning, clean design, and practical use.

## 💡 What is this?

This library lets you spin up your own FTP server with minimal setup.  
It’s built with modularity in mind, so you can plug in your own storage backends, authentication logic, and command handling.

## 🔧 Key Features

- Local, database, or cloud (Azure) file storage (It's up to you!)
- Easy setup for basic use and extensible for advanced scenarios
- TLS support (optional)
- Pluggable authentication
- Composite storage (route folders to different backends)
- Designed using .NET best practices and patterns

## 🚀 Getting Started

Add the library to your .NET project and create an `FtpServer` instance.  
You can start a server with just a few lines of code.

## 👷 Made By Students

This project was built as part of a university course, with real teamwork, feedback, and lots of iteration. We wanted to build something that actually works – and teaches us something along the way.
