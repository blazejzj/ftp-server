A flexible and easy-to-extend FTP server library built with C#.  
Created with focus on learning, clean design, and practical use.

## üîß Key Features

- Local, database, or cloud (Azure) file storage (It's up to you!)
- Easy setup for basic use and extensible for advanced scenarios
- TLS support (optional)
- Pluggable authentication
- Composite storage (route folders to different backends)
- Designed using .NET best practices and patterns

## üë∑ Who made this?

This project was built as part of a university course, with real teamwork, feedback, and lots of iteration. We wanted to build something that actually works ‚Äì and teaches us something along the way.
